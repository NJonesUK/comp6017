Node.js Coursework

Progress is as follows:

Package.json built and apparently working
Models written and loading into the DB correctly
Using sqlite due to spec
User requests URLs have been made avaliable, test using AJAX and they all work. Proper verification or testing has not been performed yet.


To get started:
npm install (if you encounter errors compiling bcrypt, just remove that from the package.json for now)
node sync.js (sets database up)
npm start (starts the node server running the app.js script)
